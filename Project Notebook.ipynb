The goal is to accurately analyze the captured visual data and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the environment in which the vehicle is traveling. The insights gained from this analysis will be crucial in improving the safety and efficiency of transportation systems, particularly in the development of autonomous vehicles. Ultimately, the project aims to contribute to the advancement of technology that will enhance our ability to navigate our world safely and efficiently."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Wmv9E5sY2Wja"},"source":["## **Table of Contents**\n","---\n","* [Video Information Extraction](#Video-Information-Extraction)\n","* [Vehicle POV Segmentation](#Vehicle-POV-Segmentation)\n","* [Usage](#Usage)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":12136,"status":"ok","timestamp":1681628539128,"user":{"displayName":"Umar Saeed","userId":"06498957772152129363"},"user_tz":-300},"id":"wZadvN0Y2wgk"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Importing required libraries\n","from IPython import display\n","from ultralytics import YOLO\n","import supervision as sv\n","from datetime import timedelta\n","import os\n","import cv2"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"HSGHPI-R24UU"},"source":["## **Video Information Extraction**\n","---"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":3,"status":"ok","timestamp":1681628539128,"user":{"displayName":"Umar Saeed","userId":"06498957772152129363"},"user_tz":-300},"id":"1gTgIrME3oC_"},"outputs":[],"source":["def get_video_info(video_path):\n","    \n","    #
